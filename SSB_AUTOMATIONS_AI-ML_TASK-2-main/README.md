# SSB_AUTOMATIONS_AI-ML_TASK-2

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

**1. Collect a Dataset:**

> Obtained the Hotel booking demand dataset from a public source.

**2. Set Up Your Project**

> Create a Local Directory.

**3. Create Your Jupyter Notebook**

> Create a Jupyter Notebook and name it 'EDA.ipynb'.

**4. Import Libraries**

> Import libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation and visualization.

**5. Load the Dataset**

> Load your dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

**6. Basic Data Inspection**

> **Display the first few rows of the dataset:**

>> Use the '.head()' method to view the first few rows.

> **Display basic statistical details:**

>> Use the '.describe()' method to get statistical details like mean, std, and percentiles.

> **Check for missing values:**

>> Use the '.isnull().sum()' method to check for missing values in each column.

> **Print column names:**

>> Use the '.columns' attribute to print column names and identify the actual names.

**7. Data Visualization**

> **Histograms:**

>> Create histograms to understand the distribution of numerical features.

> **Scatter Plot:**

>> Create scatter plots to visualize the relationship between two numerical variables (e.g., 'lead_time' and 'adr').

> **Box Plot:**

>> Create box plots to visualize the distribution of a numerical feature by a categorical feature (e.g., 'adr' by 'hotel' type).

> **Pair Plot:**

>> Create pair plots to visualize relationships between multiple numerical features.

> **Correlation Heatmap:**

>> Create a heatmap to visualize the correlation between numerical features.

**8. Summarize Key Findings**

> # Key Findings:

>> 1. The distribution of key numerical features was visualized using histograms.
>> 2. The relationship between lead time and average daily rate (ADR) was analyzed using scatter plots.
>> 3. The distribution of ADR across different types of hotels was examined using box plots.
>> 4. Relationships between multiple numerical features were explored using pair plots.
>> 5. The correlation between numerical features was summarized using a heatmap.
